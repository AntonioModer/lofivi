#LoFiVi

LoFiVi uses a force-directed graph to visualise folder structures. 

Like its big sister [LoGiVi](https://bitbucket.org/rmcode/logivi), LoFiVi was inspired by other visualisation software like [Gource](https://code.google.com/p/gource/) or [Cytoscape](http://www.cytoscape.org/). I always was quite intrigued by the beautiful graphs they created and therefore wanted to learn how to make use of [force-directed graphs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing) myself.

LoFiVi mainly started as a test bed for LoGiVi. I wanted to be able to play around with the creation of a graph and the physical forces needed to create a decent layout. Since the creation of a graph in LoFiVi is far more simple than in LoGiVi, I can use it to find the best way to represent that graph in code, while making it easy (and efficient) to apply forces and update it. 

### Instructions

LÃ–VE currently can only read files from LoFiVi's save directory ([according to](https://bitbucket.org/rude/love/issue/985/add-an-open-file-popup-dialog-function#comment-15482823) one of the developers this will be changed in Version 0.10.0 though).

When you run LoFiVi for the first time it will set up the necessary folders for you and open them with your Finder / Explorer.

Now just place the folder structure you want to visualise into the root folder and re-run LoFiVi (or just press the R-Key if LoFiVi is still open).
